Dear Prof. Santaeulalia,
Dear Albert,

I hope my message finds you well and healthy!

Kindly find within this folder the contents of my submission for the Final Project in Quantitative Macroeconomics. 

Please, accept my sincere apologies for not being able to entirely complete all the tasks I have intended to on time. 
I have recently realized that my plan was quite ambitious under the circumstances. 
Nevertheless, I am committed to finishing it in the next couple of days if not for grading, at least for feedback's sake which would be highly appreciated.
I will continue uploading my progress in this folder.

Thank you in advance for your time and consideration!

Wishing you a warm and joyful holiday season ahead!

Kind regards,
Ivana
