Dear Pof. Santaeulàlia,
Dear Albert,

I hope my message finds you well!

Please, kindly find here the contents of my submission folder:

- HW_1_IVANA_GANEVA.html   -> Main report with all relevant plots and comments for the tasks given
- HW_1_IVANA_GANEVA.Rmd    -> R markdown used to create the final HTML report; contains all the R codes required for the analysis and plotting
- CODES_CHANGES.csv        -> An additional file used to link the occupations' codes correctly
- STEM.csv                 -> An additional file used to establish the STEM-grouping of occupations based on the U.S. Census Bureau categorization

The original data file extracted from the IPUMS CPS data set is larger than 25MB, so it could not be uploaded here. 
[This link](https://mega.nz/file/tbpgVSJI#kDPf8nAB6rzsn3UGD82Zo7PRDCfrR7FUTx0I41PcSl0) goes to the location where I stored it instead, should there be a need to replicate the creation of the smaller data frames in extra folder 1.

Since I will instead work with the RData file generated from the original CPS extraction when coding the analysis in R, I also provide the link to it [here](https://mega.nz/file/1PxCAAhB#sMueIEbe_vaUNXWNgQu2LwF1aMCiqHP-K9oelGuD6BA).

Thank you in advance for your time,
Ivana
